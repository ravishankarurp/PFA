            <p class="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
                First of all, a massive THANK YOU loads for signing up to help run the spectacular <span class="font-bold text-blue-700">GrammarFest this Saturday!</span> 🥳 It's going to be an absolute blast, plus we'll be raising some much-needed funds to help our fantastic boys at school. I really hope you're all as excited about this incredible fair as we are! ✨

                I've put together some super helpful instructions in the form of FAQs right here. Please take a moment to read through them carefully, and if any questions pop up, don't hesitate to ping me (email or WhatsApp) – I'm here to help! 💌

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-green-800 mb-3">📍 Where Do I Start?</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
                    When you arrive at the GrammarFest, keep an eye out for a friendly sign near the entrance that will direct you to collect your <span class="font-bold text-green-700">VOLUNTEER badges!</span> 🌟
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
                    Please wear your badges proudly for the duration of your session. It helps us showcase just how much we depend on incredible volunteers like YOU to run such a big and brilliant event! 💪
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
                    Your badge will clearly show your name, the location of your stall, and the timings you're expected to be there. As a little thank you from the PFA for your precious time and efforts, you'll also receive <span class="font-bold text-green-700">£5 worth of tokens!</span> 🎁
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
                    As a general rule of thumb, please aim to arrive at your stall at least <span class="font-bold">5-10 minutes before your session begins.</span> This little head start helps us get everything running smoothly and on time! ⏰
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-yellow-800 mb-3">🎪 What Do I Do At The Stall?</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
                    Don't worry, you won't be left guessing! Each stall will have clear price lists and instructions to help you run things like a pro. ✅
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
                    <span class="font-bold text-red-700">Important Note:</span> Except for the Entrance, Token/Raffle counters, Uniform stalls, and the Bar – <span class="font-bold underline">all other stalls are CASHLESS only!</span> You'll be expecting payment in <span class="font-bold text-yellow-700">TOKENS.</span> The number of tokens needed will be clearly marked on your stall's price list. 🪙
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
                    You'll also have a handy plastic tub at each stall – please deposit all tokens in there. These will be counted after the event to help us plan an even better fair next time! 📊
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
                    The Entrance, Token/Raffle stalls, Uniform stalls, and Bar will happily accept <span class="font-bold text-yellow-700">Cash</span> (there will be a float) or <span class="font-bold text-yellow-700">Card/Contactless</span> payments via one of our trusty SumUp machines. These machines are connected to the school's WiFi and should work seamlessly. If you encounter any wobbles with the SumUp machines, please call me immediately (my number is below)! 📞

                <p class="text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
                    Yes please! We kindly ask everyone attending, including our wonderful volunteers and their families, to purchase tickets. I got mine last week (and so did the school headmaster, Mr. Wright – he's keen! 😉)!
                </p>
                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
                    We truly hope that the £5 worth of tokens included for volunteers will help you grab a cold one (yes, the bar accepts tokens too! 🍻) or savor an exotic delicacy from our absolutely wonderful World Food Court! 🌍🍜

                    We would absolutely love to see each and every one of you at the Fest! This amazing event can only run successfully with all the fantastic help you offer. However, if you unexpectedly have to cancel, <span class="font-bold">please do phone me (a WhatsApp call is preferred)</span> so we can quickly arrange for a backup. 🤝

                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
                    Cancellations without notice can cause quite a bit of confusion, and we're really hoping to rely on your amazing support! 🙏

                    Please ensure you kindly drop the badges at the entrance on your way out of the festival. We're planning to re-use these for future PFA events, so your cooperation helps us be super eco-friendly! 🌱
